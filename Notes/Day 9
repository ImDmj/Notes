Multimedia on the web is sound, music, videos, movies, and animations.

What is Multimedia?
Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see.

Examples: Images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more
Video supprt :
Only MP4, WebM, and Ogg video are supported by the HTML5 standard.

Audio Support : 
Only MP3, WAV, and Ogg audio are supported by the HTML5 standard.

Video Tag:

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.
HTML <video> Autoplay
To start a video automatically use the autoplay attribute:

Example
<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>



-Audio Tag
Before HTML5, audio files could only be played in a browser with a plug-in (like flash).

The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard way to embed audio in a web page.
If we don't have CONTROL then player becomes transparent
<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
