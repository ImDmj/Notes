Purpose of HTML forms
How forms work
Form action and method

-HTML forms provide one way so that more content created on Web. User can fill out content 
- Forms allow us to submit data on Web server
- Allow the user to interact with web content
- What we do in forms :
	Display : Markup to display input screen -> Enter : data entered into fields -> Send : name value pair sent to server



Form Inputs :
-TextBox
-email
-Password
-TextArea
-submit
-select : single/multi select
-radio buttons : grouped by name 
-CheckBox : allows to select multipal options



-Form setting :
1)Action: URI to which data is send
2)Method :The HTTP method (GET/POST) to use
GET:
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the GET Method
-It is possible to bookmark the page with specific query string values.
-The GET method is not suitable for passing sensitive information such as the username and password, because these are fully visible in the URL query string as well as potentially stored in the client browser's memory as a visited page.
-As GET method assigns data to a server environment variable, the length of the URL is limited. So, there is a limitation for the total data to be sent.	

The POST Method
Data sent through POST method will not visible in the URL.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Using the POST Method
It is more secure than GET because user-entered information is never visible in the URL query string.
There is a much larger limit on the amount of data that can be passed and one can send text data as well as binary data (uploading a file) using POST.
Since the data sent by the POST method is not visible in the URL, so it is not possible to bookmark the page with specific query.
