What is javascript?
Why important?
History


JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.

Designed for creating network-centric applications.

Complementary to and integrated with Java.

Complementary to and integrated with HTML.

Open and cross-platform


Limitations of JavaScript
We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −

Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.

JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.

JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.

Write in Output : console.log();

1)Javascript Datatype:

Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.

Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.

Boolean e.g. true or false.

JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as object.

2)JavaScript Variable Scope
The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

3) JavaScript supports the following types of operators.

Arithmetic Operators +,-,/,*,%,++,--

Comparision Operators ==, !=, >(Greater Than),<(Less Than), >=, <= 

Logical (or Relational) Operators &&, ||

Assignment Operators = , +=, -=, *=, /=
+= : C += A => C = C+A
-= : C -= A => C = C-A

Conditional (or ternary) Operators : ? : (Conditional )

If Condition is true? Then value X : Otherwise value Y
document.write ("((a < b) ? 100 : 200) => ");


typeof Operator
The typeof operator is a unary operator that is placed before its single operand, which can be of any type. Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand



if(condition){
	if condition true
}
else if(condition){
	something/////
}
else{
	no condition
}

if((a%2) == 0){
	no even
}
else{
	odd
}


loops:
1)for loop
2)while loop
3)do while
4)for each

while(condition){
	kjdfhskdhhks
}


do{
	jfhjghkjhkjhgk
}(condition)

for(initialization; condition, increment/decrement){
	  a = 0				a <10     a++/a--

	  sum +=a;

}
values ={10,20,30,40,50};



foreach(var x in values){
	sum +=x;
}
