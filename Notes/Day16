DOM : Document Object Model
Using DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

What all we can do with DOM:
JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.


The getElementById Method
The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.


The innerHTML Property
The easiest way to get the content of an element is by using the innerHTML property.
The innerHTML property is useful for getting or replacing the content of HTML elements.


1)Document DOM :
This object represents web page
Methods:
 document.getElementById(id) :	Find an element by element id
document.getElementsByTagName(name): 	Find elements by tag name
document.getElementsByClassName(name) :	Find elements by class name

document.getElementByTagName(p)

2)Changing HTML Elements
Method	Description
element.innerHTML =  new html content	 : Change the inner HTML of an element
element.attribute = new value	: Change the attribute value of an HTML element

element.setAttribute(attribute, value) : 	Change the attribute value of an HTML element
element.style.property = new style	: Change the style of an HTML element


Finding HTML Elements by HTML Object Collections
This example finds the form element with id="frm1", in the forms collection, and displays all element values

3)DOM CSS :
document.getElementById(id).style.property = new style

document.getElementById("p2").style.color = "blue";

4)DOM event : 
HTML events in JS:
When a user clicks the mouse
When a web page has loaded
When an image has been loaded
When the mouse moves over an element
When an input field is changed
When an HTML form is submitted
When a user strokes a key
