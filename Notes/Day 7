- How we can Use CSS3 Transitions
To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

the CSS property you want to add an effect to
the duration of the effect

-The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.

The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:
ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end

- Delay the Transition Effect
The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.

-Transition + Transformation
The following example also adds a transformation to the transition effect:

Example
div {
    -webkit-transition: width 2s, height 2s, -webkit-transform 2s; /* Safari */
    transition: width 2s, height 2s, transform 2s;
}
